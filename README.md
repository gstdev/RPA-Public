# Use Case
Client needed hundreds of Word documents (.doc and .docx) converted to PDF format.  There are existing tools to accomplish batch PDF conversions, but the problem is that a majority of these documents contained pending changes and those revisions/comments were displayed in the PDF.  We did not find a tool that contained configuration settings to approve all changes prior to the PDF conversion.

# Manual process to approve changes, change review display format, and export document to PDF
